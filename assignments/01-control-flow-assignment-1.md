## Control flow assignments
1. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.
```
Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) 
Expected Output :
Number of even numbers : 5
Number of odd numbers : 4
```
2. Write a Python program to construct the following pattern, using a nested for loop.

```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
```

3. Write a Python program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
Sample Output :
```
fizzbuzz
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
```

4. Write a Python program to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.
```
Expected Output:

Input a number: 6                                                       
6 x 1 = 6                                                               
6 x 2 = 12                                                              
6 x 3 = 18                                                              
6 x 4 = 24                                                              
6 x 5 = 30                                                              
6 x 6 = 36                                                              
6 x 7 = 42                                                              
6 x 8 = 48                                                              
6 x 9 = 54                                                              
6 x 10 = 60 
```
5. Write a Python program to print alphabet pattern 'L'
Expected Output:
```
 *                                                                      
 *                                                                      
 *                                                                      
 *                                                                      
 *
