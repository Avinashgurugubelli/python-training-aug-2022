## What is Object oriented programming (OOPS)
- Python is a multi paradigm programming language, it supports Functional programming and also Object oriented programming.

### What is Object?
- Examples: Bird:
    - An object has two characteristics:
        - Attributes:
            - example attributes of a bird: name (lets say parrot), color, feathers
        - Behavior:
            - Fly, if it a parrot it can sing
- Object is an instance of a class.
## What is a class:
- Class is a blueprint for the object.

```
class Bird:
    # attributes
    - name, age, color
    # Behavior
    - def fly()
```

### Syntax
- Class name always starts with capital letter. and it is camel case
- Example:
```
# class is a keyword in python
class Employee:
    
    def __init__(self):
        pass
```
