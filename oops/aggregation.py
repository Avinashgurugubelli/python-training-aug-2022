Aggregation (Has-A Relationship)

Keys words: Holds, Part of life.

Aggregation is a special type of association used when ever there exists a WHOLE PART relation ship between the two classes.

Here Whole is made up of one or more parts.
Part can be added or removed from the whole without disturbing its, functionalities.
The lifecycle of a PART class is independent of the WHOLE classâ€™s lifecycle, in other words, WHOLE and PART are independent of each other (one can exists with out the other).
Examples:

WHOLE	     ->     PART
------------------------
Team	            Player
Club	            Member
Library	            Book
Car	Music           player
Youtube Channel	    Subscriber
